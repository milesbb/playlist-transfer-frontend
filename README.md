# Playlist Transfer Frontend

[Try the mock-up here!](https://milesbb.github.io/playlist-transfer-frontend/)

![croppedwebimg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f943f917-311f-4079-8a33-58412443b4c8)

This repository contains the **frontend** for the Playlist Transfer website, built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

The project's main goal is to make it easy for people to archive and transfer their music playlists between apps/providers. Down with the walls between music providers!

This is part of a wider full-stack project, [check out the backend here](https://github.com/milesbb/playlist-transfer-backend) and [check out the python based playlist import/export service here](https://github.com/milesbb/playlist-import-export-service)!

**Currently in early infancy and under construction, come back later!**
