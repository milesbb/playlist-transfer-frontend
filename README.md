# Playlist Transfer Frontend

This repository contains the **frontend** for the Playlist Transfer website, built using **React**.

The project's main goal is to make it easy for people to archive and transfer their music playlists between apps/providers. Down with the walls between music providers!

This is part of a wider full-stack project, [check out the backend here](https://github.com/milesbb/playlist-transfer-backend)!

**Currently in early infancy and under construction, come back later!**

# Wanting to Contribute?

This is not a super serious project and still in it's early infancy. In the future, I may begin to create small 'easy first issue' issues that people can pick up to get some experience working on a project. In general though feel free to comment on anything, always down to discuss and learn!

Feel free to also hit me up/learn more at [my website 'milesbb.tech'](https://milesbb.tech) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/milesbaileybraendgaard/)!
